# What is this?

This is a module that implements the [MUNE](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rkmo0t9k4Q) solo toolkit in FoundryVTT. In short, it adds a window with buttons for quickly rolling various aspects of MUNE.

Additionally, [here is a link](https://empaitirkosu.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/i-made-a-thing-about-how-to-play-solo/) to the original post telling the world about MUNE.
